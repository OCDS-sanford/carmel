Elijah representes the prophetic tradition of Carmel and is an inspiration to live in the presence of God, seeking him in solitude and silence with zeal for God's glory. The Secular Carmelites live the propheticdimension of Christian life and Carmelite spirituality by promotig God;s law of charity and truth in the world, above all by making themselves the voice of those who cannot, on their own, express this love and this truth.
